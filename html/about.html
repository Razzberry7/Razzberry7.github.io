     <h2 style="text-align: center; text-justify: inter-word;">
      I'm a Senior at Rowan University, where I am currently pursuing
      <br> an accelerated master's degree in Computer Science. I am extremely
      <br> passionate about programming, and wish to pursue a career in
      <br> software engineering. In my free time, I am very interested in
      <br> game development, and am currently working on passion projects.

     <h2>
        I am most comfortable programming in Java, as that is what the
        <br>curriculum at Rowan University is based around. From various classes
        <br>I have used MySQL, C, Perl, Javascript, and HTML. From my internship at
        <br>Lockheed Martin I became well-versed in C++. And, I have personally
        <br>learned how to code in C# (for Unity game development). I still have
        <br>much to learn in these languages, but feel confident in my ability to 
        <br>use these and learn new ones as well.
     </h2>
     <h2>
        I enjoy traveling, learning new languages, music, and exercising. I'm currently
        <br>learning how to speak Korean and have plans to learn to play the drums.
        <br>If you want to know more about what kind of things I like to do, just ask!
