    <h2>I'm a Junior at Rowan University, where I am currently pursuing
      <br> a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I am extremely
      <br> passionate about programming, and wish to pursue a career in
      <br> software development. In my free time, I am very interested in
      <br> game development, and am currently working on passion projects.</h2>
      <h2>I am most comfortable programming in Java, as that is what my
        <br>current CS courses at Rowan University are using. I have personally
        <br>dabbled in C#, Javascript, HTML, and Python, but I still have more
        <br>to learn in these languages.
